Any good Jekyll-based blog should start with a blog about using Jekyll, right?

I came to Jekyll from the world of Wordpress, a platform that I've used for quite a few sites. Wordpress is a great CMS, especially for someone new to content on the web. I've built a few sites for friends and family, and they were able to quickly grasp the concepts at play in their Wordpress dashboards. The editor feels like Microsoft Word, everything is graphical and flashy. You don't have to think about what goes where, and how it's laid out.

But I'm a hacker.  I'm a tinkerer.  I want to feel like I have full, unfettered control over my site, down to the miniscule details of where things exist on the page. I find that Wordpress, in an effort to be simple, hard to break, and idiot-proof, tends to get in the way more than it ends up helping me.

So, I started looking for an alternative. I'd recently gotten into the idea of writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) after wrestling a Word document into submission (fighting with text editors seems to be a thing with me). There's something very freeing about separating the pure content from the displaying of that content.  In Markdown, I just say I want a header.  I don't have to say how that header should look, what font it should use, its alignment, etc.

Knowing that I wanted to write in Markdown, I originally stumbled across, not Jekyll, but Octopress. It has a cute little Octopus typing on a typewriter as a mascot.

Octopress is billed as "a blogging framework for hackers."  Turns out, it's basically Jekyll with extra stuff and some sensible defaults and plugins.  I toyed around with Octopress for a little while, but then decided to dig deeper, and check out vanilla Jekyll.

Looking around for examples, I found [Poole](http://getpoole.com/). Poole is a lot like Octopress in that it builds upon Jekyll with some sensible defaults, but it remains much more faithful to plain Jekyll. In fact, it *is* a full vanilla Jekyll install, just with example templates, pages, posts, and styles. This seemed like a good way to get my feet wet with real Jekyll, while also having some examples and good looking styles to fall back on. Plus, I thought the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme from Poole looked clean and striking.

###Making It My Own
Since then I've been tinkering around and customizing Hyde. The simple part is filling in your specific site name, tagline, and description. All of that can be foundin the _config.yml file. Here's that section of mine, at the time of this writing:

```
# Setup
title:            'Josh Meek'
tagline:          'Software Developer'
description:      'Development journal, project repository, and occasional blog of <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshM33k" target="_blank">@JoshM33k</a>.'
url:              http://joshM33k.github.io
baseurl:          /
```

The default setup of putting the blog posts on the homepage of the site, and the pages linked in the sidebar is mostly good enough, but I really needed a better way to show off [projects](/projects) I'd done. Creating them as plain pages would mean they would get automatically added to the sidebar in Hyde. I much prefer only having a link to 'projects' in the sidebar, and then have the projects page link off to each individual project.

So, the solution there was to make a new layout called project, and to store my project markdown files in a folder (called, what else, projects). Each project markdown file has a front matter block with `layout: project`. That tidily makes sure that the sidebar doesn't include any of the projects by default. Creating a new layout is as simple as adding an html page to the _layouts folder, called project.html. This file is exactly like the page.html file:

```
---
layout: default
---

<div class="page">
  <h1 class="page-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>
  {{ content }}
</div>
```

Finally, I needed to create that Projects page, that would be listed in the sidebar and would link to all of my projects. I could build the links to my projects manually, but I'm a developer and being lazy is in my nature. It's easier and cleaner to let Jekyll generate that list of projects for me! Step .5 to accomplishing this was to start using a custom front matter variable named description in each of my projects, which contains a short blurb about the project. The abstract or elevator pitch, if you will. I wanted the projects page to include something like that, and I didn't want to have to write each of them twice (we'll be able to pull in that variable's value in dynamic portion of the projects page).

So then, to generate the list of projects, I just need to loop through every page, and for each one with the layout "project", print the name as a link to the page, and the project description as defined in the markdown file. Simple. I'm sure I'll make some modifications to the projects page as I use Jekyll, but for now I'm very pleased with how it looks, and how relatively easy it was to add functionality to Jekyll.
