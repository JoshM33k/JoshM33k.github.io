So, this is my first pass at setting up a blog/personal site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  I'm planning to write a blog about my thoughts on using Jekyll so far, but spoiler alert, it's pretty great.

Long term, this site will list my projects and collect my thoughts as I continue to grow and learn as a developer.
