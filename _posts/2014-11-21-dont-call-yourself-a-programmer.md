title: Don't Call Yourself a Programmer?
---

I've gone through several iterations on what I tell people I do. In college and grad school, I fancied calling myself a 'computer scientist.' This was *mostly* in jest, playing on the joke that anything calling itself a science [probably isn't](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/), but it also weirdly seemed to work in the world of academia. When I had to be serious, I would tell people I'm a programmer, or simply "I write code". Now, my job title at work is developer, and that's the term I gravitate towards now. When I'm asked what I do for a living, I usually answer "I'm a software developer." This isn't, however, because I think "developer" is inherently more important sounding than programmer, or coder, just that I've found it to be the easiest explanation for people, without requiring more questions.

Not everyone agrees that developer and programmer are interchangeable though. Back in 2011 Patrick McKenzie wrote a blog post giving career advice and included the suggestion to [not call yourself a programmer](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/).

I *mostly* agree with his argument against the title. I've noticed that the term 'programmer', for better or worse, has a stigma to it. It can bring to mind visions of infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters. The fear is that describing yourself as a programmer might make someone think that the software got written, but it wasn't actually *designed*. There was no finesse, no higher craft, no forethought. You slapped something together, probably from a spec written by an *actual developer*.

But in reality, that's goofy, right? Often what you're called really has nothing to do with your development skills. Just because someone has a fancy, overwrought job title doesn't mean they can actually implement [FizzBuzz](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/). There are lots of ways to get job title, and pure development merit it might not always be.

In reality, many programmers/developers/engineers get *far* too worked up over job title (and boy do they get [oh so worked up](http://ask.slashdot.org/story/12/11/10/2038211/ask-slashdot-developer-or-software-engineer-can-it-influence-your-work)). This is true in your profession, and even more true in life in general:

**Your worth isn't based on what you call yourself, your worth is derived from your actions**.

You say you're a software engineer, and have the resume to back it up? Rad. You've got a killer resume but would rather just be called a programmer? That's rad too. In the end it's just a word, and what you do is what truly matters.
