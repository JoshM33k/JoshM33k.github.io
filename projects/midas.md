title: M.I.D.A.S. - Metrics Identification of Attack Surfaces
description: Attempting to find a metric or set of metrics that can accurately predict a program's attack surface.
---

M.I.D.A.S. is the Metrics IDentification of Attack Surfaces, and was my master’s thesis at Ball State.  An attack surface a measurement for the ways in which a system can be attacked.  The attack surface typically is measured once a program is completely written, and is done by examining a system before you install the program, and then afterwards.  The difference in attack surface is the attack surface measurement for the given program.  Or, put simply, the difference is the collection of insecurities and vulnerabilities added to the system by the new program.

What this research strived to do was to find a design metric that could accurately predict attack surface, so that before any code is written, based solely on the design of your program, you can have some idea of the attack surface, and how your program will affect the vulnerability of a system it is installed on.
