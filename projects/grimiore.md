title: Grimiore - Lab Imaging System
description: A web-based computer lab imaging system that allows administrators to easily reconfigure an entire lab of computers in minutes.  This allows a lab to accommodate back-to-back classes that have entirely different software and operating system needs.

Grimiore is a web based computer lab imaging system that I co-developed while at Hanover College.  Grimiore gave us the ability to very quickly re-image an entire lab of computers, meaning each class using a lab could take advantage of different programs, configurations, and even operating systems, without having to compromise with other classes to get something that works for everyone.  Grimiore can re-image an entire lab in just a few minutes, and can usually be done in the 10 minutes between classes.

I co-authored a paper on Grimiore that was published in the 2009 Preceedings of the ACM SIGUCCS conference, which can be found [in the ACM Digital Library](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1629501.1629507&coll=DL&dl=ACM&CFID=303302669&CFTOKEN=96874572).
