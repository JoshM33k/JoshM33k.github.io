Since creating [Physical.media](http://physical.media), my in-progress album release tracking website is a side project, I think it should also be a learning experience.

I use Java every day at work, so this project is a good excuse to branch out into a language I don't get to use very often, Python.  I started in my first Computer Science course with Python (and loved it at the time) but haven't spent much time with it since, moving on to C++ and predominantly Java.

There are a couple great looking modules for building a RESTful api in Python, called Bottle and Flask.  They seem pretty comparable..

python Bottle to create the RESTful API
AngularJS for the frontend, with BootStrap
Wanting to develop as much as possible on ipad, using prompt 2, transmit, pythonista, connecting to Nitrous.io
