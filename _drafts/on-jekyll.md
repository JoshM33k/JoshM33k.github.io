title: On Jekyll, About Jekyll
---

Any good Jekyll-based blog should start with a blog about using Jekyll, right?

I came to Jekyll from the world of Wordpress, a platform that I've used for quite a few sites. Wordpress is a great CMS, especially for someone new to content on the web. I've built a few sites for friends and family, and they were able to quickly grasp the concepts at play in their Wordpress dashboards. The editor feels like Microsoft Word, everything is graphical and flashy. You don't have to think about what goes where, and how it's laid out.

But I'm a hacker.  I'm a tinkerer.  I want to feel like I have full, unfettered control over my site, down to the miniscule details of where things exist on the page. I find that Wordpress, in an effort to be simple, hard to break, and idiot-proof, tends to get in the way more than it ends up helping me.

So, I started looking for an alternative. I'd recently gotten into the idea of writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) after wrestling a Word document into submission (fighting with text editors seems to be a thing with me). There's something very freeing about separating the pure content from the displaying of that content.  In Markdown, I just say I want a header.  I don't have to say how that header should look, what font it should use, its alignment, etc.
